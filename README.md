# Generate-Insights-to-Solve-a-Supply-Chain-Issue-in-the-FMCG-Domain

This repository contains my submission for the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 2. The project focuses on solving a critical supply chain issue for AtliQ Mart, an FMCG company, by building a Power BI dashboard to analyze delivery performance metrics and generate actionable insights.

# Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer, is facing challenges in retaining key customers due to poor delivery service levels. Management speculates that essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a consistent period. As a result, some customers did not renew their annual contracts.

To address this issue, the supply chain analytics team is tasked with tracking the following delivery performance metrics daily:

On-Time Delivery Percentage (OT%)
In-Full Delivery Percentage (IF%)
On-Time In-Full Delivery Percentage (OTIF%)
These metrics will help identify problem areas and ensure swift responses to improve customer satisfaction.

# Project Objectives

1. Calculate and visualize delivery performance metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%).
2. Identify patterns, trends, and insights that indicate service issues.
3. Provide actionable recommendations to improve delivery performance and customer retention.

# Tools and Techniques Used
Tools
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
SQL: For data preprocessing and querying.
Excel: For initial data exploration.

# Techniques
KPI Visualization: Displaying key metrics prominently.
Sparklines: Highlighting trends in data.
Bookmarks and Navigation Buttons: Enhancing user interactivity.
Decomposition Tree: Analyzing performance at a granular level.
DAX Functions: For complex calculations like day gaps and distinct counts.

# Insights from the Dashboard
Product Analysis:

AM Milk products had the highest demand but were often delayed or incomplete.
AM Butter showed the highest order line frequency, indicating customer preference.
AM Curd consistently achieved high full delivery rates despite delays.
Delivery Performance:

OTIF% fell below the target in Surat and Ahmedabad, suggesting these cities require operational focus.
High undelivered quantities are correlated with stock shortages for certain products.
Customer Impact:

Key customers with frequent incomplete deliveries are at risk of non-renewal.
Trends suggest prioritizing timely replenishment of AM Milk products.

# Key Learnings
- Understanding supply chain metrics and their impact on customer satisfaction.
- Using Power BI features like sparklines and decomposition trees to uncover insights.
- Designing dashboards that align with business needs and facilitate swift decision-making.
